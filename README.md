# TestFlow

TestFlow is an app I'm experimenting with -- hoping it will be a faster, cleaner, and more intuitive way 
to write test cases. Goal is to create a UI for test case design that mirrors the tree/graph/flowchart
model I have in my head, instead of the linear model of our current test design application. The app will
then generate a spreadsheet to upload into the test manager application.
